    - [x] Add `insert_knots()` method for curves, surfaces and volumes.
    - [x] Add `elevate_degree()` method for curves, surfaces and volumes.
    - [x] Add `derivative()` method for curves, surfaces and volumes.

- v0.3.0:
    - [x] Add `remove_knots()` method for curves, surfaces and volumes.
    - [x] Add `put_to_nurbs()` method for volumes.
    - [x] Get IGA elements connectivity.
    - [x] Add predefined shapes: `Circle`, `Tetragon`, `Hexahedron`.
    - [x] Add `rotate_Xc` and `rotate_Xg` methods for curves, surfaces and volumes.
    - [x] Add `translate_Xc` and `translate_Xg` methods for curves, surfaces and volumes.
